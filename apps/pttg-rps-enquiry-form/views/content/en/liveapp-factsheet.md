If it looks like you have made a mistake in your application, we will contact you before making a decision so you can correct any errors.

We'll also tell you if you need to provide more evidence before we can make a decision.

If your circumstances change while your application is being considered - for example, if you change your name or your nationality - you can [update your details](http://example.com).

You can [withdraw your application](http://example.com) at any time, but your fee will not be refunded.
