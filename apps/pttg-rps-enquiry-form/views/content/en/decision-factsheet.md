## After you get a decision
If your application is successful, you’ll be able to view and prove your status through an online service. You will not get a physical document unless you’re from outside the EU and do not already have a biometric residence card.

You will not lose your settled status unless you leave the UK for a period of more than 5 years.

If your application is unsuccessful, you can reapply if you do so by 30 June 2021. You can also appeal the decision if you apply from 30 March 2019.
