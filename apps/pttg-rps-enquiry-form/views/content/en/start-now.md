If you’ve been invited to take part in the pilot of the EU Settlement Scheme,
use this form to ask a question about the process or about an individual application.
We’ll reply with 5 working days.

You can find out more about the pilot scheme at
[EU Settlement Scheme pilot: applicant eligibility](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/eu-settlement-scheme-pilot-applicant-eligibility).

## Before you start

You may find the answer to your question here:
[Settled and pre-settled status for EU citizens and their families](https://www.gov.uk/settled-status-eu-citizens-families).

## What you’ll need

We’ll ask for your name and email address so we can reply to you.

If your question is about an existing application, make sure you use the same email address that was used to apply:
this is the address that your confirmation email was sent to.
We’ll also need the application reference number and applicant’s details.
