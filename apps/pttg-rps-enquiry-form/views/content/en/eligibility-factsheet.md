To be eligible for settled status, you’ll need to:

-  be an EU citizen, or a family member of an EU citizen
-  have been living in the UK continuously for 5 years (‘continuous residence’)
-  have started living in the UK by 31 December 2020

If you’ve lived in the UK for less than 5 years, you’ll generally be eligible for ‘pre-settled status’ instead.

If you’re a non-EU citizen, you will need to show your relationship to an EU citizen living here.
